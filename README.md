# Text Detection and Speech Conversion Project

This project leverages OpenCV, EasyOCR, and Google's Text-to-Speech (gTTS) to read and annotate text from an image and convert detected text to speech. The recognized text is highlighted in the original image, and the extracted text is saved as an audio file.

## Features
- **Text Detection**: Detects text from an input image using EasyOCR.
- **Text Annotation**: Highlights detected text with bounding boxes and labels it with the recognized text.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Converts all detected text to an audio file using gTTS.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- EasyOCR
- matplotlib
- gTTS

You can install the required libraries with:
```bash
pip install opencv-python easyocr matplotlib gtts
```

## Usage
1. **Prepare Your Image**: Place your target image in a known directory and set its path in the `image_path` variable within the script.

2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to detect and annotate text, then save it as an audio file.

```bash
python text_detection_to_speech.py
```

3. **Output**:
   - **Annotated Image**: Displays the image with highlighted text.
   - **Audio File**: Generates an audio file (`output_audio.mp3`) containing the detected text.

## Configuration
- **Confidence Threshold**: The confidence threshold for accepting recognized text can be adjusted using the `threshold` variable.
- **Language Support**: EasyOCR supports multiple languages. Modify the language list in `easyocr.Reader` as needed.

## Example Output
When you run the script, you will see an annotated image showing the detected text and an audio file containing the recognized content.
